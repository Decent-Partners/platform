# Decent Platform

**Decent** is a modular platform for creative commerce, blending Web2 tools with Web3 infrastructure to support independent creators and on-chain organizations. Our mission is to build sustainable, permissionless economies around culture, content, and community.

## Key Components

### 💬 Discourse Integration

Community feedback, project proposals, and ecosystem debates are hosted on our [Discourse forum](https://forum.decent.partners). It serves as a persistent, transparent layer for:

* Open discussion around on-chain initiatives
* Crowdsourced ideas and roadmap proposals
* Debates on governance, rewards, and protocol evolution

This helps coordinate collective decision-making across creative and technical contributors.

### 🛍️ Squarespace Commerce

Decent uses [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) to power storefronts for creators and brands. Products and services sold via Squarespace automatically integrate with our backend to trigger on-chain rewards and impact accounting using the dUSD stablecoin.

### 📺 Livepeer Streaming

We integrate [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/) for decentralized, cost-effective video streaming. Live broadcasts and content archives are linked to digital storefronts, enabling seamless content-to-commerce flows.

### 🪙 On-Chain Incentives

Our ecosystem is powered by:

* **dUSD** – a yield-bearing stablecoin used for payments and creator economies
* **KAB** – minted automatically based on real economic activity (e.g., sales, viewership), serving as the native unit of value
* **Points** – a loyalty layer offering cashback to customers and tracking economic contributions for merchants

### 🧩 Modular Design

Decent is designed to plug into existing creative tools and extend them with on-chain utility. We support:

* Programmatic minting of rewards for verified commerce
* Streaming-linked token drops
* Integration and interoperability with other collectives and their products and services.
