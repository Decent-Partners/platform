# Decent platform

**Decent** is a modular platform designed to support independent creators and on-chain collectives. 

Our mission is to develop sustainable and scalable economies from emergent cultures. 

## Key Components

### 💬 Discourse Integration

Community feedback, project proposals and the collective's discussions are hosted on [Discourse](https://forum.decent.partners). It serves as a persistent, transparent layer for:

* Open discussion around on-chain initiatives
* Crowdsourced ideas and roadmap proposals
* Debates on governance, rewards, and protocol evolution

This helps coordinate collective decision-making across creative and technical contributors.

### 🛍️ Squarespace Commerce

Decent uses [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) to power storefronts for creators and brands. Products and services sold via Squarespace automatically integrate with our backend to trigger on-chain rewards and impact accounting using the dUSD stablecoin.

### 📺 Livepeer Streaming

We integrate [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/) for decentralised, cost-effective video streaming and real time AI. Live broadcasts and content archives are linked to digital storefronts, enabling seamless media-to-commerce flows.

### 🪙 On-Chain Incentives

The Decent ecosystem is built on and around:

* **dUSD** – a yield-bearing stablecoin used for payments with yield recirculated back into the ecosystem.
* **points** – a loyalty layer offering cashback to customers and tracking economic contributions for merchants
* **KAB** – the underlying network and ownership protocol that confers legally enforceable rights and obligations.

### 🧩 Modular Design

Decent is designed to plug into existing creative tools and extend them with on-chain utility. We support:

* Programmatic minting of rewards for verified commerce
* Streaming-linked token drops
* Integration and interoperability with other collectives and their products and services.
